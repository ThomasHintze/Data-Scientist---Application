# Hoxhunt - Summer Hunter - Data Scientist Application - URL Task
My Application for Hoxhunt, Data Scientist - Summer Hunter URL-task

Three files are included.

test_urls.py contains urls used for testing the extraction functions.

extractors.py contains three simple extractiton functions.

MySolution.ipynb contains some explanation and thoughts on my implementation. It also contains further descriptions on the other two files, and a main function, that I used for testing my extraction functions.

Thank you for your time and consideration! Exciting and fun to work on these task!
